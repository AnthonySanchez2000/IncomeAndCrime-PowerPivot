## Some Key Findings
* Staten Island's median household income (**$91,310** - 1st) is only 27.367% more than the 4th ranked borough (**Brooklyn - $71,690**), but is 100% more than the 5th ranked borough (**The Bronx - $45,640**).
* It's more likely for a violent crime to be committed in Manhattan (**.897%**), or the Bronx (**1.157%**), than it is likely for any crime to be committed in Staten Island (**.711%**)
* Queens (**22,791.630 persons per sq mi**) is 4th in population density. It is 168.413% more dense than the 5th ranked borough (**Staten Island - 8,491.235 persons per sq mi**).
* If the other 4 boroughs merged, Manhattan (**71,776.275 persons per sq mi**) would still be more densely populated by more than double.

## Analysis
Poverty & proximity are two factors of crime. The Bronx's crime rate is just under 2%, whereas the citywide rate is 1.5%. Upon taking a deeper look into NYC's, by far, poorest borough, 59.5% of crime committed in the Bronx is violent. In essence, 6 out of every 10 crimes in the Bronx will be murders, r*pes, assaults, robberies, and/or burglaries. Widespread poverty is a major influence to crime in the Bronx, but what about proximity? Two-thirds (8/12) of the Bronx's precincts are more dense than the entire city's population density, with an aggregate density of 51,373.641 persons per sq. mile, 76% more than the city's. The crime rate of those 8 is 2.07% and 63% of all crime is violent. On the contrast, the 4 precincts with lower indivdual population densities aggregate to 20,404.204 persons per sq. mile and 1.66% crime rate. The violent crime share drops drastically from 63% to 49%. Safe to say that despite abject proverty in the Bronx,  crime is weighted more by proximity than crime.

Staten Island is a borough on the complete opposite side to the Bronx. Median household income is higher in Staten Island than in any other borough. The city's crime rate and population density is more than double and triple Staten Island's, respectively. The city of Phoenix (1.625M) would have to move to Staten Island in order for the population density equal to NYC's, 29,179.161 persons per sq. mile. Yet, the city of Phoenix still has less people than Brooklyn and Queens. It's pretty straight forward; 

9 of the top 10 densely populated precinct areas are located in Manhattan.
