## Some Key Findings
* Staten Island's median household income (**$91,310** - 1st) is only 27.4% more than the 4th ranked borough (**Brooklyn - $71,690**), but is 100% more than the 5th ranked borough (**The Bronx - $45,640**).
* It's more likely for a violent crime to be committed in Manhattan (**.897%**), or the Bronx (**1.157%**), than it is likely for any crime to be committed in Staten Island (**.711%**)
* Queens (**22,791.630 persons per sq mi**) is 4th in population density. It is 168.41% more dense than the 5th ranked borough (**Staten Island - 8,491.235 persons per sq mi**).
* If the other 4 boroughs merged, Manhattan (**71,776.275 persons per sq mi**) would still be more densely populated by more than double.

## Analysis
Poverty and proximity are two factors of crime. The Bronx's crime rate is almost at 2%, more than the citywide crime rate of 1.5%. It is evident the Bronx is doing comparitvely more dangerous than NYC as a whole. , 9 of the top 10 densely populated precinct areas are located in Manhattan.
